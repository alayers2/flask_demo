## Flask Demo	
This repo contains a very basic flask application, aiming to show the basics of setting up your first routes in a Flask application.

### Quickstart:
1.) Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2.) Run `flask run` from the command line

3.) Run `curl http://localhost:5000/` from a separate terminal, and you should see "Hello, World!" as the response.

### Contents

The entirety of this application lives in the `app.py` file. Inside there are 4 routes declared that demonstrate different ways of handling requests and pulling information from GET and POST requests.
